### Scenario

Explore and provide answers to key questions from people considering moving or traveling to various destinations worldwide. The goal is to help them budget effectively and understand how their current lifestyle might change when living on an average salary in a new location.

2: How does the United Arab Emirates index‚Äôs compare to New York?
3: On average how much more expensive is it to buy groceries in NY compared to India?
4: How much cheaper is it to rent and buy groceries in the Bahamas compared to NY?
5: Create Visualiztions.

:flashlight: **Task: Answer key questions for individuals planning trips/considering relocation to various destinations worldwide. Help them budget effectively and understand the impact of living on their average salary in their new environment.**

## 2. Prepare

Data needed in order to answer your questions!

The data set used ranges from January 1, 2019 (Q1) to April 2, 2020 (Q1). It contains a combination of 5 CSVs, totaling 15 columns and 4.2 million rows.

The dataset is a snapshot of the current indexes from mid-year 2024. It contains 1 csv file with 8 columns and 121 rows.

:construction: Dataset Limitations:

This data is based solely on the cost of living relative to New York City (NYC) and reflects residents earning an average salary. It does not account for varying tax rates across different countries. Additionally, the dataset represents the cost of living up to mid-year 2024, without considering potential fluctuations in expenses when someone decides to move or travel. For a more accurate estimate, a separate analysis should be conducted to understand how expenses vary at different times of the year.

## 3. Process

Clean and Organize your data to get rid of any errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies.

:hammer_and_wrench: Tool: Python Jupyter Notebook (Packages: Pandas)

An exploratory analysis was conducted to familiarize ourselves with the dataset and assess whether any cleaning was necessary. After thoroughly examining the data using various cleaning and inspection techniques, we concluded that the data was clean and required no further modifications.
