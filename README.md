### Scenario

Explore and provide answers to key questions from people considering moving or traveling to various destinations worldwide. The goal is to help them budget effectively and understand how their current lifestyle might change when living on an average salary in a new location.

## 1. Ask

Ask Questions!

Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

:flashlight: **Task: Answer key questions for individuals planning trips/considering relocation to various destinations worldwide. Help them budget effectively and understand the impact of living on their average salary in their new environment.**

## 2. Prepare

Data needed in order to answer your questions!

[Data Source](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_by_country.jsp), [License](https://www.numbeo.com/premium/commercial-license) and [Credits](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/)

The data set used ranges from January 1, 2019 (Q1) to April 2, 2020 (Q1). It contains a combination of 5 CSVs, totaling 15 columns and 4.2 million rows.

The dataset is a snapshot of the current indexes from mid-year 2024. It contains 1 csv file with 8 columns and 121 rows. 

:pencil: Data Ensures ROCCC: 

- Reliability: Numbeo is the world‚Äôs largest cost of living database.
- Original: Numbeo isa crowd-sourced global database of quality of life data: housing indicators, perceived crime rates, healthcare quality, transport quality, and other statistics.
- Comprehensive: This dataset contains country, cost of living index, rent index, groceries index, restaurant price index and local purchasing power index. 
- Current: Cost of Living Index by country 2024 Mid-Year. These indexes are historical and they are published periodically.
- Cited: Intended for public access and use in accordance with the existing license agreement. ([License](https://www.numbeo.com/premium/commercial-license)).

:construction: Dataset Limitations:

This data is based solely on the cost of living relative to New York City (NYC) and reflects residents earning an average salary. It does not account for varying tax rates across different countries. Additionally, the dataset represents the cost of living up to mid-year 2024, without considering potential fluctuations in expenses when someone decides to move or travel. For a more accurate estimate, a separate analysis should be conducted to understand how expenses vary at different times of the year.

## 3. Process

Clean data is the best data. You will need to clean up data to get rid of any errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies.

:hammer_and_wrench: Tool: Python Jupyter Notebook (Packages: Pandas)

An exploratory analysis was conducted to familiarize ourselves with the dataset and assess whether any cleaning was necessary. After thoroughly examining the data using various cleaning and inspection techniques, we concluded that the data was clean and required no further modifications.

## 4. Analyze

You will want to think analytically about your data. At this stage you might sort and
format your data to make it easier to perform calculations, combine data from multiple sources and create tables with your results!

### Actionable Insights:

:bulb: **Conclusions**

##

- Our analysis successfully addressed our clients' questions, providing valuable insights into how their lifestyle might change if they relocate to a new area. We also offered guidance on budgeting for travel to various global destinations.

- We identified the countries with the highest cost of living indexes, highlighting the most expensive places to live.

- Our comparisons demonstrated how much more affordable or costly other locations are relative to an average salary in New York City.

- We also provided visualizations to help our clients better understand the data and the potential impact on their lifestyle.
